Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table
It turns out we can do it in one-pass. While we iterate and inserting elements into the table, 
we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. 
If it exists, we have found a solution and return immediately.

Time complexity : O(n)O(n). We traverse the list containing nn elements only once. Each look up in the table costs only O(1)O(1) time.

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most nn elements.
